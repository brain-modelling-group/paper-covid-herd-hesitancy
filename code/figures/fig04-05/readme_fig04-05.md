Value of r eff at 30 days after insertion of clusters of infections (B.1.1.7), 
whose size range from 1 to 20. The dotted line 30 > 1. The value vp indicates 
the fraction of the population aged 16 years is reff = 1. Red dots indicate scenarios 
for which reff at 30 days > 1. The value vp indicates the fraction of the 
population aged 16 years old and over that received the vaccine.
