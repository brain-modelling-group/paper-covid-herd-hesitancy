Effective reproductive number on day 30 after cluster insertion, as a function
of vaccine efficacy(transmission blocking) and vaccine coverage (fraction of
vaccinated people of the eligible population aged 0 and over). S5A Inserted
cluster size of 20 infected with B.1.1.7, eligible population is aged 0 years
and over. S5B Inserted cluster size of 20 infected with B.1.617.2, eligible
population is aged 0 years and over. The red box indicates Queensland’s
current vaccination state (August 2021). This regions spans the area defined
by vaccine efficacy between 0.8 (conservative efficacy) and 0.95
(high efficacy); and, the fraction of people that have been fully vaccinated
(∼ 22%). These percentages are relative to the size of the total population
total population in Queensland (5.1M). The yellow box highlights the area
where of vaccination coverage that is expected to be reached by the end of
2021 (∼ 80 of eligible population/ ∼ 64% of total population). The green box
highlights the area of vaccine coverage where, according to our modelling
results, Queensland would reach herd immunity (∼ 80 of eligible population/ ∼
72% of total population).
